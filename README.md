# Correcthorse in Elixir

Ostensibly a rewrite of my [Correct Horse Battery Staple](https://github.com/paulanthonywilson/correcthorsebatterystaple) in Elixir for no particular reason.

In reality a [Furlough project](https://furlough.merecomplexities.com) to explore:

* Elixir deployment (to AWS, apparently)
* Doing something in Live View
* Maybe being clever with ETS tables
* Whatever else turns up
